        During my time at Pearson Online Learning Services, I was a key
        contributor to the development of a robust analytics platform that
        transformed the way internal teams accessed and utilized data. Working
        closely with marketing, recruitment, student support, and executive
        leadership, I helped design and implement a scalable solution that
        streamlined reporting, enhanced decision-making, and provided real-time
        insights into key business metrics. By leveraging modern technologies
        like React, Node.js, BigQuery, and Salesforce, we significantly reduced
        the manual workload for data analysis, improved communication across
        teams, and optimized the allocation of marketing spend.
